# Generative Decay
[Generative Decay](https://amaykataria.com/#/GenerativeDecay) surfaces the dichotomy between the objective and subjective phenomenon in this world. It’s inspired by the theory that physical objects do not exist as things in themselves but only as perceptual phenomena or bundles of sensorial data situated in time and space. With the use of computer vision and computation algorithms, the artist paints a mental image of a familiar physical object like flower vase to reflect this duality in reality. This ethereal, constantly updating, and generative image represents the perception of a physical object from the artist’s mind by constantly shedding layers of appearances and unravelling the subjective nature of human consciousness. 

It's developed by Amay Kataria in 2018 using an open-source creative coding library called [Open-Frameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) for the Algomotion group show at the Art & Technology Studies department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
